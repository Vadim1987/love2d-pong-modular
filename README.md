Modular Pong for Love2D
A clean, modular version of the classic single-player Pong game, written in Lua for the Love2D framework.

Modular codebase: Each part of the game is a separate file for maximum clarity and future extensions.
No magic numbers: All constants are named and collected in one file.
Multiple AI strategies: Switch between simple, random, delayed, or perfect AI for the right paddle.
Flexible bounce logic: Switch between simple reflection or bounce with paddle velocity effect.
Ready for upgrades: Horizontal paddle movement, round puck, custom rendering, and more.
Controls
Left Paddle:
Q — move up
A — move down
(Or adapt code for mouse/touch if needed.)
Quit: ESC
